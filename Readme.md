## Java Swing Package

Java Swing is a set of GUI components for building graphical user interfaces in Java applications. In this project, we utilize Java Swing for creating the various interactive components such as buttons, labels, text fields, and password fields. These components are used to design the user interface of the Bank Management System, providing a user-friendly experience for interacting with the application.

## Getting Started

To begin exploring the Bank Management System, follow these steps:

1. Open the `Login.java` file located in the project's source code.
2. Compile and run the `Login.java` file to start the application.
3. You will be prompted to enter your credentials or sign up if you are a new user.
4. After logging in, you can access various features of the application from the main menu.
